It was a pleasant Saturday afternoon of the Monsoon season. I was sitting on the cot, thinking about how to make my computer vision program faster and more parallel.

Suddenly a thought popped up in my brain **"Isn't that just pattern matching !!"** and the after thought was "__Then what is machine learning without pattern matching !!__".

So, I turned to the internet for the correct answer. 

Then I learned<sup>Not a pun</sup> that Machine Learning is the evolved version of Pattern Matching.

As [Chomba Bupe on Quora](https://qr.ae/pN2uBA) explains in the easiest possible way :

>Pattern recognition (PR) is the engineering application of various algorithms for the purpose of recognition of patterns in data.
>Thus PR can use machine learning (ML) or not at all.
>
>This is because PR, being an engineering field, can be achieved even by traditional handcrafted algorithms that don't even learn, they may be just fixed engineered systems for PR.

>ML is the field that solely involves learning from examples. ML can be useful in improving PR systems, in fact all ML systems are applied in PR systems but not all PR algorithms use ML algorithms.

>Thus ML and PR are different, one is more on the practical side whereas the other is more on the theoretical side.

>PR is an engineering application of ML.

An article on Alibaba Cloud blog says :

Deep learning, machine learning, and pattern recognition are commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence. Despite the overlapping similarities, these concepts are not identical.

>In the early 1990s, many realized that there was a more effective way to create pattern recognition algorithms, particularly replacing researchers with probability and statistics. This paradigm led to the creation of machine learning.

So, Let me make this more clear for you by the definitions on Wikipedia:

#### Pattern Recognition 

Pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data.
It has applications in image analysis, information retrieval, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.

#### Machine Learning 

Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.

#### Deep Learning 

Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
