If you do not want to open any other app and just want to use your browser OR you are using Chrome OS.

There are two ways you can create your own personal in-browser notepad. The first one is using the ```<object>``` tag.

### The example is given below :

<object data="data:text/html, <html contenteditable>" width="300" height="300" style="border:1px solid #00f"></object>

OR alternatively, you can go to the below link which is a local file.

[data:text/html, <html contenteditable>](data:text/html, &lt;html contenteditable&gt;)

You can copy, paste the text, 
You can make it Bold, Italic, Underlined, change the fonts and colors.

Keep in mind that the text is actually being edited as HTML.
