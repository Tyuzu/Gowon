I am a website developer by profession. You can alternatively call it UI Developer and UX Designer. My expertise is in CSS3 and HTML5. Though I write JavaScript for some trivial tasks, I keep the use of JS minimal.

I have done my graduation in **Computer Science and Engineering** with two minor degrees : 

1. Data science with Machine learning
2. Forensic Science and Crime Scene Investigation.

I am developing an Operating System as a side project. Also, I am creating some computer vision based projects.

I also do some back-end stuff but only limited to tweaking and reverse engineering.

My knowledge ranges from basic subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics to Machine Learning and Operating systems. From Politics, Evolution and History to Human behaviour and Forensic Science.

In this blog I will share my knowledge and opinions about almost every topic related and not-related to technology.
